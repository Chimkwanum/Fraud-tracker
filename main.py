# Step 1: Data Preparation
# Assuming you have a CSV file containing transaction data with a "fraud" label column
data = pd.read_csv("transaction_data.csv")

# Separate features and labels
X = data.drop("fraud", axis=1)
y = data["fraud"]

# Split data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Model Training
# Train a Random Forest classifier (you can choose a different algorithm if desired)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 3: Model Evaluation
# Predict on validation set
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 4: Social Media Profile Picture Check
def check_profile_picture(image_url):
    # Implement your code to check the authenticity of the profile picture
    # You can use image processing or facial recognition techniques
    # Return True if the picture is considered real, False otherwise
    return True

# Step 5: Company Email and Website Verification
def verify_company(email, website):
    # Implement your code to verify the authenticity of the company's email and website
    # Use email validation libraries or APIs for email verification
    # Use web scraping techniques to extract information from the company's website and compare
    # Return True if both email and website are considered valid, False otherwise
    return True

# Step 6: Fraud Detection and Alert Generation
def detect_fraud(transaction):
    # Predict fraud probability using the trained model
    fraud_probability = model.predict_proba([transaction])[0][1]

    if fraud_probability > 0.5:
        # Perform social media profile picture check
        is_real_profile_picture = check_profile_picture(transaction["profile_picture"])

        if is_real_profile_picture:
            if transaction["is_company"]:
                # Perform company email and website verification
                is_valid_company = verify_company(transaction["email"], transaction["website"])
                if is_valid_company:
                    # Send an alert (you can customize the alert mechanism based on your requirements)
                    send_alert(transaction)

def send_alert(transaction):
    # Implement your code to send an alert
    # This could be sending an email, generating a system notification, or using a messaging platform
    print("ALERT: Potential fraud detected in transaction:", transaction)

# Example usage
transaction = {
    "amount": 1000,
    "profile_picture": "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
    "is_company": False,
